# beets-getlrc

A [beets](https://beets.io) plugin that downloads synced `.lrc` lyric files for your music library.

## Quick Start

Install:

```bash
pipx inject beets beets-getlrc
```

Enable the plugin:

```yaml
plugins:
  - getlrc
```

Fetch synced lyrics:

```bash
beet getlrc
```

Your music files will end up like:

```text
Artist/
└── Album/
    ├── Song.flac
    └── Song.lrc
```

## What does this do?

Some digital audio players (like the Sony Walkman, HiBy R3, Shanling M0 Pro, FiiO devices, etc.) can display **synced lyrics** — the kind that scroll line-by-line as the song plays. However, they usually require a separate `.lrc` file stored right next to each track.

Beets already has a built-in `lyrics` plugin that fetches plain-text lyrics and stores them directly inside your library database. **beets-getlrc** fills a different gap: it fetches *synced* `.lrc` files from [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net) and saves them as sidecar files directly alongside your FLAC or MP3 files.

### Fallback Options

If synced lyrics aren't available for a track, the plugin can optionally:

- **Fall back to plain lyrics as `.lrc` files** — write unsynced lyrics to `.lrc` files so your DAP can still display them (though without timing)
- **Store plain lyrics in the beets database** — save unsynced lyrics in your library so they're searchable and preserved

These options let you build a more complete lyrics collection, even for tracks where lrclib.net doesn't have synced versions.

## Installation

### If you installed beets with pip:
```bash
pip install beets-getlrc
```
### If you installed beets with pipx (recommended):
```
pipx inject beets beets-getlrc
```

## Configuration
Add getlrc to your beets configuration file (config.yaml)

plugins:
  - getlrc
  -  ... your other plugins

adjust the options as desired:


| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `auto` | `yes` | Fetch lyrics automatically when importing new music (runs after all import prompts complete) |
| `overwrite` | `no` | Replace `.lrc` files that already exist |
| `timeout` | `30` | Seconds to wait before giving up on a single request |
| `retries` | `3` | How many times to retry on timeout or network errors |
| `delay` | `0.2` | Delay in seconds between requests (to be respectful to lrclib.net) |
| `cache_results` | `yes` | Cache results in the beets database to avoid re-checking tracks |
| `recheck_days` | `30` | Days before retrying cached "not found" results |
| `fallback_to_plain` | `no` | Store plain (unsynced) lyrics in the beets database if synced ones unavailable |
| `fallback_to_plain_lrc` | `no` | Write plain (unsynced) lyrics as `.lrc` files if synced ones unavailable |
| `stats` | `yes` | Print a summary of results when done |
| `progress` | `yes` | Show per-track progress and progress bar |
| `workers` | `4` | Number of concurrent requests; increase for faster fetching on good networks |
| `quiet_import` | `no` | Suppress terminal output during automatic import-time fetching |

## Usage

### Automatic (during import)

When you import new music with `beet import`, the plugin automatically fetches lyrics in the background. It waits quietly until all import prompts are done, then starts fetching so your terminal stays clean.

### Manual (on demand)

Run it manually any time with the `beet getlrc` command:

| Command                  | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beet getlrc`            | Fetch lyrics for **all** tracks in your library                       |
| `beet getlrc beatles`    | Only fetch for tracks matching "beatles"                              |
| `beet getlrc -a beatles` | Fetch for albums matching "beatles"                                   |
| `beet getlrc -f`         | Force overwrite existing `.lrc` files                                 |
| `beet getlrc -p`         | Pretend mode — shows what *would* be fetched without writing anything |
| `beet getlrc -q`         | Quiet mode — suppress per-track output and progress bar |
| `beet getlrc -w 8`       | Use 8 worker threads for parallel fetching |
| `beet getlrc --delay 1`  | Wait 1 second between requests |

## How it Works

1. **Query metadata** — Uses artist name and track title from your library tags
2. **Search lrclib.net** — Looks for synced lyrics matching the metadata
3. **Save as `.lrc`** — Writes synced lyrics as sidecar files next to your audio
4. **Fallback options** — Optionally stores plain lyrics if synced ones aren't found
5. **Cache results** — Remembers what was found to avoid re-checking
6. **Handle errors** — Continues processing even if some requests timeout or fail

## Typical Workflow

1. Import music with `beet import` → plugin fetches quietly in background
2. After import completes → you see a summary of what was found/created
3. Sync music to your DAP, Plexamp, Navidrome, or other player
4. Enjoy synced lyrics that scroll as songs play
### Example
#### Code
```
beet getlrc wetleg
getlrc: No synced lyrics: Wet Leg - Wet Leg - Being in Love
getlrc: Created: Wet Leg - Wet Leg - Chaise Longue
```
#### Resulting Directory Structure
```text
├── Being in Love.flac
├── Chaise Longue.flac
└── Chaise Longue.lrc
```

## Requirements
- beets 2.0.0 or newer
- python 3.9 or later
- internet

## Features & Notes

- **Resilient** — Handles network timeouts gracefully and continues processing. If a request times out, that track is logged and processing continues with the next one.
- **Fast** — Uses multiple worker threads (configurable) for parallel requests, making large library fetches much quicker.
- **Smart** — Caches results in the beets database so previously-checked tracks aren't re-queried every time you run the command.
- **Customizable** — Configure fallback lyrics options, number of workers, retry behavior, delays, and more.
- **Clean import** — During `beet import`, fetching happens silently after all user prompts are done, keeping your terminal uncluttered.
- **Synced lyrics only by default** — If lrclib.net doesn't have synced lyrics for a track, no `.lrc` file is created (unless you enable a fallback option).

### Both synced and plain fallback
```yaml
plugins:
  - getlrc
getlrc:
  fallback_to_plain: yes
  fallback_to_plain_lrc: yes
```
